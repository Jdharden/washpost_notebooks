## How The Washington Post Analyzed HUBZone Contacts in Washington, DC. 

The codes used for this project were all written in R. 

To examine the distribution of contracts, the Post examined three variables, which include location, poverty rates and income factors. The locations of firms and contracts awarded were obtained from https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/. The parameters used to pull the data obtained from the FPDS' data dictionary and EzSearch FAQ. 

HUBZone firm recipients were geocode using the U.S. Census geocoder.

Results of the geocoding: 

HUBZone was designed to offer firms a path to securing federal contracts based on geography â€” not veteran, gender or race
based qualifications used by some other programs. 

But the program appears to have inadvertently fostered a new divide. A Washington Post analysis iin April 2019 of 20 years of
HUBZone data shows that about $800 million earmarked for firms enrolled in the program was awarded to just 11 D.C. businesses.
